This program was created entirely by me, to separate noise from the vocals from the noise in an itterative manner using the latest AI models.
I have realised, while surfing the online forums, that people who were the victims of the sonic weapon attack during the peaceful protest in Belgrade, March 15th 2025, are traumatised and need to hear what sound the sonic weapon emitted. Here is the original video of the incident:

This works by providing the samlpe you want to clean, and the representative sample that shows what the result should sound like.

The jet engine sound sample of less than 1 second is used for data comparison:
